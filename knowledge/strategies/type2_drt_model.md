# Type 2 DRT (Dealing Range) Model

## Overview
The Type 2 DRT model identifies high-probability reversal setups using dealing range levels and inversion fair value gaps. This model targets equal highs/lows as liquidity pools.

## Key Concept: Equal Highs = Liquidity (Not Resistance)
When you see equal highs forming, that's **liquidity stacking**, not resistance. The market will use those equal highs as a target at some point.

## The Type 2 DRT Framework

### Step 1: Identify Liquidity Raid + HTF Level
- Price raids **sell-side liquidity** (sweeps lows)
- Price keys off a **higher timeframe level** (FVG, OB, or key level)
- Look for a **swing low** that holds

### Step 2: Confirm Support with Consequent Encroachment
- **Consequent Encroachment (CE)** = 50% level of a FVG
- If candle bodies **fail to close through** the CE level = support confirmed
- This tells you the level is being defended

### Step 3: Grade the Dealing Range
Draw the dealing range from **equal highs** (top) to the **swing low** (bottom):

```
Equal Highs ─────────── HIGH (Buy-side liquidity target)
     │
    25 DRT ─────────── 25% level
     │
    50 DRT ─────────── 50% level (equilibrium)
     │
    75 DRT ─────────── 75% level
     │
Swing Low ──────────── LOW (where sell-side was raided)
```

**Confirmation**: Look for FVGs at each DRT level (25, 50, 75). If FVGs exist at these levels, you have the correct dealing range.

### Step 4: Identify the Inversion FVG
- On the leg that swept sell-side liquidity, price leaves a FVG
- When price **turns around and closes ABOVE that FVG**, it becomes an **Inversion FVG**
- The FVG flips from resistance → **support**

**Key**: The inversion FVG should be **nested at the 25 DRT level** for highest probability.

### Step 5: Entry at Inversion FVG
- Wait for price to **retrace back into the Inversion FVG**
- Order block wicks into the **25 DRT level**
- Enter LONG at this confluence zone
- **Target**: The equal highs (buy-side liquidity)

## Entry Checklist (Bullish Type 2 DRT)

- [ ] Equal highs identified (buy-side liquidity target)
- [ ] Sell-side liquidity raided (price sweeps lows)
- [ ] Price keys off HTF level (FVG, OB)
- [ ] Swing low forms and holds at consequent encroachment
- [ ] Dealing range graded (high to low)
- [ ] FVGs present at DRT levels (25, 50, 75)
- [ ] Inversion FVG identified (price closed above former resistance FVG)
- [ ] Inversion FVG nested at 25 DRT level
- [ ] Enter LONG at retracement to Inversion FVG
- [ ] Target: Equal highs

---

## Bearish Type 2 DRT (Inverse)

- [ ] Equal lows identified (sell-side liquidity target)
- [ ] Buy-side liquidity raided (price sweeps highs)
- [ ] Price keys off HTF level (FVG, OB)
- [ ] Swing high forms and holds at consequent encroachment
- [ ] Dealing range graded (low to high)
- [ ] FVGs present at DRT levels
- [ ] Inversion FVG identified (price closed below former support FVG)
- [ ] Inversion FVG nested at 75 DRT level
- [ ] Enter SHORT at retracement to Inversion FVG
- [ ] Target: Equal lows

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **DRT** | Dealing Range - The range between significant high and low |
| **25/50/75 DRT** | Quarter levels of the dealing range |
| **Consequent Encroachment (CE)** | 50% level of a FVG |
| **Inversion FVG** | FVG that flips from resistance to support (or vice versa) after price closes through it |
| **Equal Highs/Lows** | Liquidity pools where stops rest |

---

## Why This Works
1. **Equal highs = liquidity magnet** - Market makers target these pools
2. **25 DRT level = discount zone** - Institutional buying area
3. **Inversion FVG = confirmed shift** - Former resistance becoming support shows institutional intent
4. **Confluence** - Multiple factors (DRT level + Inversion FVG + OB) = high probability

---

## One-Sentence Summary
> Raid sell-side → Price holds at CE → Grade dealing range → Wait for Inversion FVG at 25 DRT → Enter on retracement → Target equal highs

# Candle Range Theory (CRT)

## Overview

Candle Range Theory (CRT) is a trading concept that focuses on the price range (high to low) of a single candlestick. The core idea is that each candle represents a trading range, and when broken down into lower timeframes, the high and low often act as turning points - forming the most important liquidity levels.

**Key Principle:** The highest and lowest price traded during a period (day, week, hour, etc.) become targets for future price action.

## The 3-Candle Structure

CRT typically involves three candles, each with a specific role:

| Candle | Role | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **1st Candle** | Defines Range | High = CR (Candle Range High), Low = CRL (Candle Range Low) |
| **2nd Candle** | Creates Sweep | Sweeps liquidity above/below range, then reverses |
| **3rd Candle** | Provides Entry | Continuation in the reversal direction |

## CRT Rules

### Valid Setup (Short Example)
1. First candle establishes the range (CR high, CRL low)
2. Second candle sweeps ABOVE the CR high
3. Second candle CLOSES BACK INSIDE the range (not above it)
4. Third candle = Short entry targeting CRL

### Invalid Setup
- If second candle **closes above** CR high → Setup invalid
- Market likely to continue pushing upward, not target CRL

### Valid Setup (Long Example)
1. First candle establishes the range
2. Second candle sweeps BELOW the CRL low
3. Second candle CLOSES BACK INSIDE the range
4. Third candle = Long entry targeting CR high

## CRT + Trend Following (Recommended Approach)

Trading CRT counter-trend is risky. The better approach is **CRT with the trend**:

### Bullish Trend - Long Setups Only

1. **Identify uptrend** - Clear higher highs and higher lows
2. **Wait for correction** - Price pulls back (preferably to discount zone)
3. **Apply CRT to bearish candles only** during the correction
4. **Mark high/low** of each bearish candle
5. **Watch next candle:**
   - If it breaks AND closes below CRL → Invalid, skip
   - If it sweeps below CRL but closes back inside → Valid setup
6. **Enter long** on FVG in lower timeframe
7. **Stop loss** below the FVG
8. **Targets:** 1:1 for half position, let rest run

### Bearish Trend - Short Setups Only

1. **Identify downtrend** - Clear lower highs and lower lows
2. **Wait for correction** into **premium zone**
3. **Apply CRT to bullish candles only** during the correction
4. **Mark high/low** of each bullish candle
5. **Watch next candle:**
   - If it breaks AND closes above CR → Invalid, skip
   - If it sweeps above CR but closes back inside → Valid setup
6. **Enter short** on FVG in lower timeframe
7. **Stop loss** above the FVG
8. **Targets:** 1:1 for half position, let rest run

## Entry Optimization

Instead of entering immediately after sweep candle closes:

1. **Zoom to lower timeframe** (e.g., 1H → 5min or 15min)
2. **Wait for Fair Value Gap** to form after the sweep
3. **Place limit order** at FVG level
4. **Stop loss** beyond the FVG
5. Better R:R and more precise entry

## Pre-NY Session CRT (Alternative Approach)

Popular approach: Apply CRT to the **1-hour candle before NY open**

**Why it works:**
- NY session known for strong reversals
- Often sweeps London session liquidity then reverses
- High probability if sweep occurs and price returns inside range

**Caveat:** This is often counter-trend. Use with caution.

## Quick Reference Checklist

### Long Setup (Bullish Trend)
- [ ] Market in clear uptrend
- [ ] Price in correction/pullback (discount zone preferred)
- [ ] Identify bearish candle in correction
- [ ] Mark CR high and CRL low
- [ ] Next candle sweeps below CRL
- [ ] Next candle CLOSES back inside range
- [ ] Drop to lower TF, find bullish FVG
- [ ] Enter long at FVG, stop below
- [ ] TP1: 1:1 (close half), TP2: Let run to next resistance

### Short Setup (Bearish Trend)
- [ ] Market in clear downtrend
- [ ] Price in correction/pullback (premium zone preferred)
- [ ] Identify bullish candle in correction
- [ ] Mark CR high and CRL low
- [ ] Next candle sweeps above CR high
- [ ] Next candle CLOSES back inside range
- [ ] Drop to lower TF, find bearish FVG
- [ ] Enter short at FVG, stop above
- [ ] TP1: 1:1 (close half), TP2: Let run to next support

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Trading in choppy markets** - CRT works best in trending conditions with clear impulse and correction legs

2. **Entering too early** - Don't trade just because price reversed. Wait for:
   - Proper liquidity sweep
   - Close back inside the range
   - Candlestick to complete

3. **Ignoring market context** - Even perfect CRT setups can fail:
   - Near major news releases
   - At strong higher timeframe S/R levels
   - Always check the bigger picture

4. **Counter-trend trading** - CRT against the trend is lower probability. Prefer trend-following CRT setups.

## CRT + SMC Confluence

CRT combines powerfully with Smart Money Concepts:

| SMC Element | CRT Integration |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Liquidity Sweep | The sweep candle targets CR/CRL liquidity |
| FVG Entry | Enter at FVG formed after sweep |
| Premium/Discount | Only trade CRT in correct zone for trend |
| BOS/CHoCH | Sweep + close inside = potential structure shift |
| Order Blocks | CRT sweep may coincide with OB reaction |

---

## Timeframe Combinations

| Higher TF (Range) | Lower TF (Entry) |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Daily | 1H or 4H |
| 4H | 15min or 30min |
| 1H | 5min or 15min |
| 15min | 1min or 3min |

---

## One-Sentence Summary

> Mark a candle's high/low as liquidity levels → Wait for sweep that closes back inside → Enter on LTF FVG in trend direction → Target opposite liquidity level.

---

## Risk Management

- **Half position at 1:1** - Guarantees break-even if stopped out
- **Let remainder run** - Capture larger moves
- **Stop beyond FVG** - Logical invalidation point
- **Only trade with trend** - Higher probability setups

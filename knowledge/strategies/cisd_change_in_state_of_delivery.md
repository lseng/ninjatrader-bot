# Change in State of Delivery (CISD)

## Overview

Change in State of Delivery (CISD) is a trading concept that identifies when the market shifts from one directional bias to another. It's similar to Break of Structure (BOS) but with a key difference: **CISD is measured by candle bodies, not wicks**.

**Core Concept:** When the market has been consistently moving in one direction, CISD signals that a reversal is occurring and the market is about to hunt liquidity in the opposing direction.

---

## CISD vs Break of Structure (BOS)

| Concept | Measured By | What It Shows |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **BOS** | Swing low/high (including wicks) | Structure violation |
| **CISD** | Series of up-close/down-close candle bodies | Change in order flow delivery |

**CISD Definition:** The last series of up-close (or down-close) candles that gets displaced through and closed beyond.

## How to Identify CISD

### Bullish CISD (Market shifting from bearish to bullish)

1. Market has been selling off (bearish delivery)
2. Identify the **last series of down-close candles** before the reversal
3. Mark the **top of these candles** (not the wicks, the candle highs)
4. Wait for price to **displace through and close above** this level
5. Valid bullish CISD = Market now in bullish delivery

### Bearish CISD (Market shifting from bullish to bearish)

1. Market has been buying up (bullish delivery)
2. Identify the **last series of up-close candles** before the reversal
3. Mark the **bottom of these candles** (not the wicks, the candle lows)
4. Wait for price to **displace through and close below** this level
5. Valid bearish CISD = Market now in bearish delivery

---

## Context is Everything

CISD only makes sense with proper context. You MUST identify:

1. **Draw on Liquidity** - Where does price want to go?
2. **For Bullish CISD:** Buy-side liquidity must be resting above
3. **For Bearish CISD:** Sell-side liquidity must be resting below

Without a valid liquidity target, CISD signals lack context and may fail.

## The Complete CISD Setup

### Required Elements

1. **Manipulation** - One last move in the opposing direction (sweep)
2. **Sweep of Liquidity** - Internal high/low gets taken
3. **Failure to Displace** - Price fails to continue in sweep direction
4. **CISD Confirmation** - Close through the last series of opposing candles
5. **Displacement** - Strong follow-through in the new direction

### Entry Process

1. Identify the draw on liquidity (where are the highs/lows?)
2. Wait for manipulation leg (sweep of internal liquidity)
3. Watch for CISD (close through last series of candles)
4. Enter after CISD confirms
5. Stop loss at the manipulation leg high/low
6. Target the opposing liquidity pool

## Displacement + CISD

**Displacement** is crucial for validating CISD:

- **Displacement** = Strong follow-through past a swing point
- Not just a wick/sweep, but actual **closing through** the level
- Shows conviction in the new direction

### What to Look For

1. **Sweep without displacement** → Not valid, wait
2. **Sweep + rejection + displacement** → Valid CISD setup
3. **Close through FVG** → Additional confirmation

---

## Multi-Timeframe Validation

For highest confidence, validate CISD across multiple timeframes:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| 1-minute | Do we have CISD? |
| 5-minute | Do we have CISD? |
| 15-minute | Do we have CISD? |

If all timeframes show CISD in the same direction → Strong confirmation

## Practical Trading Process

### Step-by-Step (Short Example)

1. **Mark external liquidity levels**
   - External buy-side (highs to the left)
   - External sell-side (lows to the left)

2. **Mark internal liquidity**
   - Internal highs being generated
   - Internal lows being generated

3. **Identify the context**
   - Are we in a premium zone (good for shorts)?
   - Has buy-side been taken?
   - Is there sell-side liquidity below us to target?

4. **Wait for manipulation**
   - Price comes up, takes internal highs
   - Fails to displace higher
   - Sweeps and rejects

5. **Wait for CISD**
   - Identify last series of up-close candles
   - Mark the candle lows (not wicks)
   - Wait for close below this level

6. **Take the entry**
   - Enter short after CISD confirms
   - Stop loss at manipulation high
   - Target opposing liquidity (sell-side below)

## Quick Reference Checklist

### Bearish CISD Entry
- [ ] Buy-side liquidity has been taken (manipulation)
- [ ] Sell-side liquidity exists below (target)
- [ ] Last series of up-close candles identified
- [ ] Price closes BELOW the candle lows (not wicks)
- [ ] Displacement shown (strong follow-through)
- [ ] Enter short, stop at manipulation high
- [ ] Target: Sell-side liquidity

### Bullish CISD Entry
- [ ] Sell-side liquidity has been taken (manipulation)
- [ ] Buy-side liquidity exists above (target)
- [ ] Last series of down-close candles identified
- [ ] Price closes ABOVE the candle highs (not wicks)
- [ ] Displacement shown (strong follow-through)
- [ ] Enter long, stop at manipulation low
- [ ] Target: Buy-side liquidity

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Taking the trade too early**
   - Waiting for CISD confirmation prevents getting stopped out
   - Don't enter just because price reversed - wait for the CLOSE through CISD level

2. **Ignoring context**
   - CISD without valid draw on liquidity = random noise
   - Always identify where price SHOULD go before taking the trade

3. **Confusing sweep with displacement**
   - Sweep = wick through level
   - Displacement = candle body closes through level
   - Need displacement for valid CISD

4. **Not validating across timeframes**
   - Check 1m, 5m, 15m for alignment
   - All showing same direction = higher probability

---

## CISD + Fair Value Gaps

For optimal entry after CISD confirms:

1. Wait for CISD close
2. Look for Fair Value Gap (FVG) formed after displacement
3. Enter at FVG level for better risk:reward
4. Stop loss beyond the FVG
5. Target the opposing liquidity pool

---

## The Pictionary Analogy

Think of trading like Pictionary:
- **Guessing too early** = Taking trades before CISD confirms → Often wrong
- **Waiting for the drawing to be clear** = Waiting for CISD + displacement → Higher probability

Don't try to be first. Wait for the market to OBVIOUSLY show you the direction through:
1. Sweep of liquidity
2. CISD confirmation
3. Displacement

Then take your trade with confidence.

## Integration with Existing SMC Framework

CISD fits between steps 3 and 4 of our SMC framework:

| Step | Element | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Liquidity Raid | Sweep of highs/lows |
| 2 | Displacement | Strong move showing intent |
| 3 | BOS | Break of structure |
| **3.5** | **CISD** | **Confirmation that delivery has shifted** |
| 4 | Retracement | Pullback to FVG/OB for entry |
| 5 | Target | Opposing liquidity pool |

CISD adds confidence that the shift is real, not just a fake-out.

## One-Sentence Summary

> Mark the last series of up/down-close candles → Wait for price to close through that level (not just wick) → Enter in the new direction targeting opposing liquidity.

## Key Quotes

- "The main thing to understand is waiting for confirmation that the market doesn't want to continue in the prior direction"
- "Use CISD as the lens that affirms all the other context"
- "Don't guess early - wait for the entire drawing to be clear in front of you"

[{"text":"MACD Strategy This MACD strategy I m about to show you is one of the highest win rate strategies you can possibly do in trading. It is very easy to use, works in almost every single market, and most importantly, it makes money. Well enough talk, lets get straight into it. The MACD or the Moving Average Convergence Divergence is one the most popular technical indicators used by traders. Essentially this indicator uses moving averages to find trends in markets, and its pretty damn good at it too. Now, if you re an experienced trader, you ve probably used or heard about the MACD indicator before. But the MACD indicator by itself, is just alright to be honest. So, make sure you watch this full video to see how I pair it with some other indicators to make it perform so much better. First things first, let s add the MACD indicator to our chart. To do that . Now that we have the MACD indicator added, lets make sure we know how the MACD actually works. The MACD is made up of 4 different components. The MACD line, the signal line, the histogram, and the zero line. The MACD line which is the blue line, in most cases is usually a 12 day moving average, the signal line, which is the orange line, is usually a 26 day moving average. Next we have the histogram, which represents the difference between the MACD line and the signal line. So for example, the smaller the space between the two lines, the smaller the histogram gets. The bigger the space, the bigger it gets. You can also see once the MACD line crosses above the signal line, the histogram turns green and if the MACD line crosses below the signal line it turns red. And finally, we have the zero line, which basically represents the center of the MACD indicator. Now that we know the 4 components, lets make sure we know how to them. The MACD indicator is insanely good at finding trends in markets. How you can tell if a chart is about to have an upward trend is by looking for a cross upwards between the MACD line and the Signal line. For example, here the macd crosses above the signal line indicating the chart is in upward momentum, and here the macd crosses below the signal line indicating it s in downward momentum. You can also use the histogram to indicate how much momentum there actually is. So, if the histogram is getting bigger, that means there is an increase in momentum. If it s getting smaller, there is a decrease in momentum. So how you want to use this indicator is by when the lines cross upward, but only if they cross below the zero line. If they cross and its above the zero line you wouldn t enter a trade. It s the same thing with shorting, you only enter a short trade if the lines are crossing downward, and is ABOVE the zero line. So as you can see, this indicator is extremely easy to use. But the problem most traders encounter, is that they use this indicator by itself. Let me tell you why this doesn t work. The MACD indicator works extremely well if the market is in a trend. So for example here, the MACD indicator is doing a great job indicating when the price is about to move upward. Because the chart is in an upward trend. But here, the price is in a downward trend, but the MACD is still signaling to buy long even though the price is going down. To fix this issue, for example if we are trading long, we only want to trade if the market is in an uptrend. You never want to trade against the trend, because the odds will always be against you. So, an easy way to figure out if the market is in an uptrend. You simply just need to add a 200 day moving average. To do this Once we have the indicator added, you ll just see a single line. If the price is above that line, the market is in an uptrend. If the price is below that line, the market is in a downtrend. So after learning that we only want to buy when the market is in uptrend, if we re going long of course. if we put all this together, we buy if the macd lines cross below the zero line mark, and the current price also above the 200 day moving average. This will guarantee that you are only trading when the market is in an uptrend, which is a very power combo. If you wanted to short, you would just do the exact opposite. Make sure the price is below the 200 day average and the macd lines are crossing downward above the zero line. So as an example we would enter a long trade right here, because the macd lines are crossing upward below the zero line, and the current price is above the 200 day moving average. Now what I like to do is set a stop loss below the 200 day moving average, so the 200 day almost acts as a wall that the price has to break through to hit my stop loss. Then I like to have a 1.5 profit ratio for my profit target mark. So as you can see for this example, the strategy worked exactly as we wanted it to, and we made money. But, we can still make this trading strategy even better. This macd strategy combined with a 200 day moving average, works extremely well only if there is a lot of price movement. Where the strategy starts to get kind of iffy and giving false signals, is when the chart starts going sideways and losing momentum. So as you can see here the chart is moving sideways and lost almost all of its upward momentum and the macd is giving lots of false signals. If you traded here, odds are you probably lost money. To fix this issue we have to combine the MACD with price action. To do this, identify a key support or resistance where price hits and bounces. So as you can see the prices goes down, hits this point, and reverses upwards. The next step is to wait for the price to hit the same key level again. Once it does, we are expecting the price to bounce off this support and go upwards just like it did before. But as a clear note, just because we made the support and it bounced off this before, doesn t mean that it will always do that again. It can easily break through the support and drop lower if it has enough momentum. If we want to make sure the price is about to change in momentum, that s when we bring out the MACD indicator. So what you would do, is make sure the price above the 200 day moving average, once the price hits the support made, wait for the lines on the MACD to cross below the zero level, and that s when you enter the trade. So I just revealed to you how the MACD, 200 day moving average, and using support and resistances levels gives and extremely high win rate with this strategy. All I ask for in return is if you to take 2 seconds of your time and like this video. If you want to stay up to date with my future strategies make to subscribe. Because in my next video, I m planning to release a strategy that works even ever better than this MACD strategy. Hope you guys learned something from this video, and I ll see you guys next time. this macd strategy I'm about to show you is one of the highest win rate strategies you can possibly do in trading it is very easy to use Works in almost every single market and most importantly it makes money well enough talk let's get straight into it the macd or the moving average convergence Divergence is one of the most popular technical indicators used by Traders essentially this indicator uses moving averages to find Trends in the market and it's pretty damn good at it too now if you're an experienced Trader you've probably used or heard about this macd indicator before but the macd indicator by itself is just all right to be honest so make sure you watch this full video to see how I pair it with some other indicators to make it perform so much better first things first let's add the macd indicator to our chart to do that you're going to go to trading view or whatever chart website you prefer and then you're going to go up here to the indicators tab type in macd and click this top one now that we have the macd indicator added let's make sure we know how the macd actually works the macd is made up of four different components the macd line the signal line the histogram and the zero line the macd line which is the Blue Line in most cases is usually a 12-day moving average the signal line which is the orange line is usually a 26 day moving average next we have the histogram which represents the difference between the Mac D line and the signal line so for example the smaller the space between the two lines the smaller the the histogram gets the bigger the space the bigger it gets you can also see once the macd line crosses above the signal line the histogram turns green and if the macd line crosses below the signal line it turns red and finally we have the zero line which basically represents the center of the macd indicator now that we know the four components let's make sure we know how to use them the macd indicator is insanely good at finding Trends and markets how you can tell if a chart is about to have an upward trend is by looking for a cross upwards between the macd line and the signal line for example here the macd crosses above the signal line indicating the chart is in an upward momentum and here the macd crosses below the signal line indicating it's in a downward momentum you can also use the histogram to indicate how much momentum there actually is so if the histogram is getting bigger that means there is an increase in momentum if it's getting smaller there's a decrease in momentum so how you actually want to use this indicator is by when the line crosses upwards but only if they cross below the zero line if they cross and it's above the zero line you wouldn't want to enter the trade it's the same concept with shorting you only want to enter a short trade if the lines are crossing downward and it's above the zero line so as you can see just by watching this this indicator is extremely easy to use but the problem most Traders encounter is that they only use this indicator by itself let me tell you why this doesn't work the macd indicator works extremely well if the market is in a trend so for example here the macd indicator is doing a great job indicating when the price is about to move upward because the chart is in an upward Trend but here the price is in a downward Trend but the macd is still signaling to buy long even though the price is going down a simple fix to this issue for example if we're Trading long we only want to trade if the market is in an uptrend you never want to trade against the trend because the odds will always be against you so so an easy way to figure out if the market is in an uptrend you simply just need to add a 200 day moving average to do this you're going to go to the indicators tab on trading View and type in EMA which stands for exponential moving average or moving average exponential click the top one then you're going to go here click the settings of the EMA and you're going to go to inputs and change the length to 200 which is going to make it a 200 exponential moving average then you're going to go to style and I like to make mine red but you can make it whatever color you want once we have the EMA indicator added you'll see just a single line if the price is above that line the market is in an uptrend if the price is below that line the market is in a downtrend so after learning that we only want to trade in an uptrend Market if we're going long so all we have to do is put it all together we buy if the macd line crosses below the zero line Mark and the current price also is above the 200 day moving app average this will guarantee that you are only trading when the market is in an uptrend which is a very powerful combo if you wanted a short you would do the exact opposite so make sure the price is below the 200 day moving average and the macd lines are crossing downward above the zero line so as an example we would want to enter a long trade right here because the macd lines are crossing upwards below the zero line and the current price is

ik over mijn mac the grudge match kids een medisch experts en luigi sap solutions een monnik omstreden sygic data and i'll see you guys nextime Bollinger Bands In this video, I m going to show you a trading strategy that works so good I just have to tell you guys. And it involves using Bollinger Bands and RS. It s simple, easy to use, and has a pretty high success rate if you use it correctly. Well enough talk, let s get straight to it. The first step for this strategy is setting up the Bollinger bands. If you ve never used Bollinger Bands before, your lucky you clicked this video, because this indicator is absolutely incredible and is great way to find support and resistance levels. So the first thing we want to do is to go to trading view or whatever trading chart platform you use, click the indicators tab, and type in Bollinger Bands . Now, the default settings trading view will give you, are nice, but we want to change them for this specific strategy. First thing you want to do is go to the length section and change this value to 30, make sure the standard deviation is set to 2. Then I m also going to remove the background of the indicator, and change the lines to red. This is all personal preference, you can do whatever you prefer here. So if you didn t know, this is how Bollinger bands work. The center line, is a moving average. So whatever amount the length is, this indicator is going back that many candle sticks and finding the average between them. So for this strategy we are going back 30 candlesticks. The lower and upper lines are standard deviation lines. Alright we got the Bollinger Bands setup, now let s add the RSI. To do this, just go to your indicators tab, type in RSI and then click this top one that says Relative strength index Now that we have RSI added let s modify the settings a bit. Make sure that upper band is set to 70, and your lower band is set to 30. Then this length is probably going to be set to 14, make sure to change that to 13 for this strategy. If you haven t used RSI before it s a great indicator to tell you if a certain security is being overbought or oversold. If the line is above the 70 value, its being overbought, if the line is below the 30 value, its being oversold. Now it s time to pair these 2 indicators together and get some profitable trades going. Make sure you watch the rest this video, because im going to explain a crucial tip to make this strategy working just okay, to turn into a money making machine. So there are 2 different strategies you can choose from when using these indicators. Both of these strategies are built around the concept called mean reversion. What s mean reversion you my ask? Well, mean refers to the word average, and the word reversion means returning to So to put it simply, the phrase mean reversion just means returning to the average. Which is exactly what we are going to be shooting for with this strategy. So as an example, in most cases if there is extreme price movement in one direction whether its up or down, we can pretty much predict after that big price movement, the price will return back to the average (the moving average right here). So if the price goes above the upper Bollinger band, we want to enter a short trade. If the prices goes below the bottom Bollinger band, we want to enter a long trade. Simple enough right? Well, if you did this by itself, odds are it wouldn t work to good. That s why we added the RSI earlier. So as you can see in this example the price went above or below the Bollinger bands many times giving lots of false signals. So if you went in every time here, you probably lost money. To solve this issue we are going to add one more requirement. You can only go in if the RSI hits an extreme value. Meaning, we can only enter a long trade if the price moves below the lower Bollinger band and the rsi goes below the value of 25. For shorting, we will only enter a trade if the price goes above the upper Bollinger band, and the rsi goes over the value of 75. So as an example here we are looing at apple and the price starts going below the bottom Bollinger band here, but at this point in time the RSI is still not where we want it to be. So we wait it out a bit until the line goes below 25. which it proceeds to go down all the way to 20, we enter a long trade at this point, and the price returns to the average just like we predicted it would. Now there is some crucial information you need to know about this strategy or else it simply just wont work. This next tip im about to tell you is the difference between making this strategy profitable or making a money loser. Where this strategy has its faults is when the market is moving sideways. For almost all trading strategies when the markets is moving sideways it s a lot harder to predict. So as example here, the price goes below the lower Bollinger band, and the RSI is below 25, but the price just keeps on dropping. So if you entered here, you would have an absolute massive loss. So now im going to show you a nice little trick, so you know before hand before these huge price movement even happen. So in this example notice how skinny the Bollinger bands are at this point in time, they are very close together, and there is barely any price movement, and the market is moving sideways. You can also see that the RSI is being very tame and staying in between the purple rectangle and not going above or below the major points we made before. This alone, should immediately raise a huge red flag. Most times when the market is like this for a while, when the price does break in a certain direction, it goes in that direction with huge amounts of momentum. So in these types of examples, you never want to trade trying to catch a falling knife when the price starts to act like this. Let me show you another strategy we can use, to help solve this, that works like absolute magic. Here you can see the price starts to drop to the lower Bollinger band and then reverses. The next time it comes down, it makes a new lower lower from the previous low, but something interesting is happening. The RSI made a higher lower. So we have price making a lower low, but the RSI is making a higher low. This right here, is called divergence and is an absolute great sign to enter a trade, especially if rsi was previously below 25, and the price went below the lower Bollinger band. If this happens, there s an extremely great chance the price will reverse and make a new higher high. I just showed you how to pair Bollinger bands with RSI and make it a profitable trading strategy. All I ask for in return is if you can take 2 seconds out of your day and like this video. You should also watch my other video where I go over a MACD strategy which gets an 86% win rate, which is absolutely insane when it comes to trading. So go check that out, and ill see you guys next time.","id":"pCmJ8wsAS_w","title":"Bollinger Band + RSI Trading Strategy That Actually Works","microformat":{"playerMicroformatRenderer":{"thumbnail":{"thumbnails":[{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pCmJ8wsAS_w/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}]},"embed":{"iframeUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCmJ8wsAS_w","width":1280,"height":720},"title":{"simpleText":"Bollinger Band + RSI Trading Strategy That Actually Works"},"description":{"simpleText":"Bollinger Bands.

and even better at finding reversals I'm also going to be adding another indicator to this strategy to make it that much more effective let's get straight to it for all the beginners out there or for the people who don't know what the hakashi indicator is let me give you a quick overview so what we're looking at now looks as if it's just a normal chart right well actually we're looking at the hakashi indicator at work hakashi actually means average bar in Japanese so that's exactly what it's doing finding the average in the candlesticks so this is the real time chart and this is the hakashi chart so just make sure in the back of your head you know the hakashi is not the real price it's the average price instead of just looking at the hakashi candles we're going to be looking at both the real time and the hakashi at the same time so we can read and understand the chart better to do this just go to trading view go to the indicators tab and type in hakashi this will show both the real-time candles above and the hakashi candlesticks right below it now that we have the indicator added let's move on to the strategy so when trading it's a lot harder to find Trends than you might think not all Trends are going to look this simple and just have all green candlesticks going up most of the time they're going to look like this a strong Trend going up but having multiple pullbacks with red candlesticks which also might give you false signals on when to sell that's where the hakashi comes in instead of looking at this trend with a bunch of false signals that may get you to panic cell we're going to be looking at the hakashi in most cases it'll have all the same color candlesticks and a strong Trend this way it's easier to identify the trend in real time that's exactly what the hakashi is for it helps eliminate unwanted noise and shows a clearer version of the price movement let's move on to how to identify the trend there are three simple rules you must follow to identify an uptrend the hakashi candlesticks must be green they must have large bodies and they have no lower wicks in this example this would be a strong long Trend all the candles are green they have large bodies and they don't have lower Wicks it's the complete opposite for a downtrend all the candlesticks must be red have large bodies and have no upper Wicks so we all know charts gain and lose momentum all the time after a strong upwards Trend most of the time the chart will lose momentum and do a reversal in the opposite direction luckily the hocky gashi is great at finding when that moment is about to happen you can identify when a reversal is about to happen by this a doge candle a dogee candle is a Candlestick with Wix on both sides has a small body and it can be either color depending if you want to go long or short so we're going to take advantage of what we just learned the Only Rule you have to follow is you only enter after you see a dogee candle and you wait for two candles in the opposite direction with opposite features let me show you an example so you know what I mean so here you can see the price is making a downtrend then we see the chart make a dogee candle in the opposite color which indicates that there's a very good chance the price will make a reversal then we wait for two green candles with only Wicks on the top to appear to confirm the reversal if the candle has a wick on the top and the bottom we do not count that candle once the second candle with a wick only on the top appears we enter the trade so this right here will be our entry signal let me show you an example of a short the market is in an uptrend we wait to see a dogee candle appear in the opposite color we then wait for two large red candles to appear with only Wicks on the bottom once we see the two candlesticks we enter the trade so that's the hakashi indicator explains simply in a nutshell now I'm going to show you how to add another indicator to this strategy to make it that much more effective and more importantly more profitable the indicator we're going to be adding to the strategy is the stastics indicator I'm not going to be going too in depth with this indicator because one it's very simple to use and two I don't want this video to be too long to describe it simply the stochastics indicator is a lot like RSI as in if the lines are crossing above the Top Line the market is being overbought if the lines are crossing below the bottom line the market is being oversold so as an example here the lines are crossing below the bottom line indicating the market is oversold and it's likely to reverse up upwards just like most indicators though this indicator by itself isn't very good but combined with other indicators it's extremely powerful to add this indicator go to indicators tab type in stochastics and click this one right here now let me show you how to combine these two indicators to make a very powerful strategy first things first if we want to go long we want to find a point in the chart where the Scholastics indicator is crossing below the bottom line and there is weak downwards momentum we we do not want to enter a trade if the Scholastics lines are crossing below the bottom line and there's strong downwards momentum because odds are the price will keep on falling here's a perfect example the Scholastic lines are crossing below the bottom line there's a downtrend but a very weak downtrend we then wait for a dogee candle to appear once it does wait for two large body candlesticks with only Wicks at the top then we enter the trade here's one more example Scholastic lines are crossing below the bottom line there's a weak downtrend wait for the dogee candle wait for two large green candles with only Wicks on top enter the trade profit I just showed you a profitable trading strategy using the hakashi and Scholastics indicator all I ask in return is if you take 2 seconds out of your day and

Known for it s simplicity, and it s scary predictiveness of the market. Even by itself, this indicator is pretty decent. But in this video, I m going to share one of my secret strategies I like to do with this indicator, that make s it so much better. Let s get straight to it. If you haven t heard or used this indicator before, well its pretty good at finding trends in the market. Hence the name. Why this indicator is so powerful is because it does not only track the momentum of the market, but it also uses ATR. Which basically means that it also takes volatility into consideration. I m going to show you how to take advantage of this and make a lot of profitable trades. First, let s add the indicator to our chart. To do this, just go to the indicators tab on trading view, type in super trend and make sure your select this one right here. It s probably one of the easiest indicators to use on the planet. When the line s green, you buy. When the line is red you sell. Pretty self explanatory. But just like any other indicator, this indicator by itself has some problems. Let me explain. As you can see here, the indicator is doing a great job at finding the trend. It s great at showing when the market has high momentum in either direction. The problem is, the indictor is always giving buy and sell signals, even when the market is moving sideways and doesn t have a lot of momentum. And as we all know when the market is moving sideways with little momentum, it s very risky, and very hard to predict which direction it will go. And as you can see, whenever the market does moves sideways, the indicator has some losing trades. That s exactly why, if you just use this indicator by itself, and went in every time it said buy your portfolio probably wouldn t look too hot. But, I m going to show you a solution to this problem, so we only go in if the market is truly in a trend. The first strategy I m going to share with you is a great one to have in your trading arsenal. And that involves adding 3 super tend indicators. Let s go a little more in depth. Once you have 3 super tend indicators added to your chart, you re going to want to change the settings a bit. Go to the inputs tab and change the ATR period to 12 and the atr multiplier to 3. The next one you are going to set it as 10, then 1. Then the 3rd one you are going to set it as 11, then 2. Then go to the style tab and turn off these long and short icons. So when you are done, your chart should look something like this. Now how this strategy works, is we will only go in if all the lines are the same color. Let me show you an example. So here you can two of the lines are green, but one of the lines are red. This is telling us that market isn t in full momentum, and is moving sideways. So we don t go in yet. We wait for a little bit, until all the lines turn green, we enter a long posistion here. And look what happens, the chart goes up. Let s look at one more example. Here we are looking for a short trade, 2 of the top lines are red, but the bottom line is still green. We wait it out until all the lines turn red, enter a short trade here, profit. Now, you may be asking yourself, but how do I know when to exit the trade ? Well that s a good question, there are actually a lot of different ways to know when to exit the trade. You can do the classic, set a take profit at a 1.5 ratio. Whenever the price hit s that mark you exit the trade. Another exit strategy is when one of the lines change color. So here you can see all the lines turned the same color, we entered, we got a bunch of profit, then once one of the lines turn red, we exit the trade. Another strategy can use is the pairing the super trend indicator with a 200 day moving average. Why this strategy is so powerful, is because the super trend indicator is very good at finding short term trend, and the 200 day is good at finding long term trends. Let s add these indicators to our chart. Go to the indicators tab, add the super trend indicator, and just keep the default settings. Next had an exponential moving average, and change the length to 200. Now that we have the indicators set up, lets move on to how to actually use this strategy. The strategy is simple. We will only enter a long trade if the super trend line is green, and the price is above the 200 day moving average. We only enter a short trade, if the super trend line is red, and the price is below the 200 day moving average. let me show you an example. So here you can see the super trend line is green, but the price is not above the 200 day moving average yet, so we wait. Once the price is over the 200 day, and the line is still green, this is where we enter the trade. You can exit the trade, by doing a 1.5 profit ratio, or by selling simply when the super trend line turns red. Let s take a look at a short example. As you can see, the super trend line is red. But, the price is still above the 200 day, we wait for the price to go below the 200 day, make sure the super trend line is still red, and then we enter a short trade. Next, I m going to show you a bonus strategy using the ichimoku indicator. To add this indicator, go to the indicators tab and type in ichimoku. We are also going to clean up our chart because this indicator s default setting are really messy. Just uncheck the top 3 box, and the change these plot backgrounds to purple, so it s easier to see. Now that we have that setup, let me explain how the strategy works. So this purple are is called the kumo cloud. We will only enter a long trade if the super trend line is green, and the price is above the kumo cloud. We will not enter the trade if the price is is in, or below the cloud. It s the exact opposite for shorting. We only enter a short trade if the super trend line red, and the price is below the kumo cloud. Let me show you an example. So here the super trend line is green, but the price is still below the kumo cloud, so we wait. Then the price enters the kumo cloud, but we still wait until it is above the kumo cloud. We wait, then it finally goes above, we make sure are super trend line is still green. We enter the trade. Here s a short example. The super trend line is red, we don t enter until the price goes below the kumo cloud, once it does, we enter the trade. For exit strategies, you can again do a 1.5 profit ration, or you can exit the trade once the price goes inside the kumo cloud. Let me show you an example. So here we entered a trade because the super trend line was green and the price was above the kumo cloud. The price starts go, the heads back down into the kumo cloud. The moment the price hits the cloud, we exit the trade. I just showed 3 different strategies to use with the super trend indicator. All I ask in return is if you take 2 seconds out of your day and like this video. Try these three strategies and let me know which one worked the best for you!

It involves using just 2 indicators, and best of all, both of them are completely free on TradingView. The strategy is extremely easy to use, works in all markets, and it s insanely profitable. Make sure you stick around till the end of the video, because Ill be sharing some secrets to make this strategy even better and I m going to share the backtest results, to show you how it performed while taking 100 trades. Let s get straight to it. First things first, you need to get on tradingview. I ll leave a link in the description. Once your on the chart, type in any security you want to trade with. Like I said earlier, this strategy works with basically any security, so there really isn t a wrong answer. For this example, I m going to use doge. Because, why not. Once you ve selected what you want to trade. Your going to add the first indicator. The first indicator is the dema, or the double ema. If you don t know what the dema is, its basically an upgraded version of the exponential moving average. It was created in 1994 and was made to give faster signals with less lag compared to a normal ema. So this is a double exponential moving average (the blue one) and a normal exponential moving average (the red one). As you can see, the double exponential moving average is a lot lower, and is giving entry signals a lot faster than the normal ema. Which in return is giving us a lot less lag. You should also understand though, that less lag is not always a good thing. This Is because lag can sometimes help filter out noise and give a higher success rate at times. But I backtested this strategy with both a double exponential moving average and a normal moving average. And the dema performed better with this specific strategy. Once you have the double exponential moving average added, we have to change the settings a bit. Go to the settings of double exponential moving average, and we want to change the length to 200. Then go to the style tab and we are going to change it to blue, just so it s a bit easier to see. The second indicator for this strategy is one that we ve used on this channel before, and that is the supertrend indicator. To add it, go to the indicators tab, and type in super trend. Make sure to choose this one right here. Go to the settings of the super trend indicator, and make sure to change the ATR period to 12 and the ATR multiplier to 3. Now that we have the indicators added and all the settings are correct. Lets get on with how to use this strategy. In this example we are trading on DOGE/USD on the 15 minute time frame. The first rule of the strategy, is that we will only enter a long trade if the price is above the dema, the blue line. If the price isn t above the blue line, we will not enter the trade. The 2nd rule we must follow is that, the supertrend indicator must give a buy signal. Let me show you an example. So here, the price is above the 200 dema, but the super trend indicator hasn t given a buy signal yet, so we wait. We then wait and the super trend gives a buy signal. It is also important to note, that you must wait for the buy signal candle to close before entering. This candle could give a buy signal, but change before it closes. Keeping it a sell signal. So make sure you are only entering after the buy signal candle closes. Once the candle closes, we enter the trade. You are going to set your stop loss at the buy signal line of the super trend indicator. So for this example right here. Then the cool thing about this strategy is that we basically have infinite profit potential. Unlike my other trading strategies, where you set a 1.5 or 2 profit ratio, we are going to do something different with this strategy. We are only going to sell once the supertrend indicator becomes a sell signal. That s one of the reasons why this strategy is so powerful because you are going to have some trades where there s going to be a 4.2 profit ratio, or even higher. So going back to the example. We saw that the price was above the 200 dema, and the supertrend indicator gave a buy signal. We then enter the trade after the candle closed, and set our stop loss at the buy signal of the supertrend indicator. We the wait while the price goes up, for a sell signal from the supertrend indicator. The supertrend indicator then turns red and gives a sell signal. This is when we exit the trade. And as you can see, we got a profitable trade with a 4.1 profit ratio. Let s do one more example. We see price just crossed the dema, we wait for a buy signal from the supertrend, we enter, set our stop loss at the buy signal of the supertrend, then wait for a sell signal. Once we see one. We exit the trade. Profit. Lets go over an example of a short trade. After that, I will be sharing some secrets tips for you guys to help make this strategy even more profitable. Ill also share how this strategy did while making 100 trades. So for a short trade, you are going to be doing the exact opposite. Make sure the price is below the 200 dema, wait for a sell signal to occur, once it does, enter the trade, set the stop loss at the sell signal, then stay in the trade till you see a buy signal. Once you see one. Exit the trade. Profit. Now, it s time to go over some secret tips to make this strategy even better. One tip I would recommend, is for a situation like this. Where the price is below the blue line, but the super trend indicator is giving a buy signal. What I d recommend doing here, is waiting for the price to cross the 200 dema, and then entering. Rather then not going in this trade because the buy signal came before crossing the dema, we will still enter once the price crosses the dema line. If you only entered when the price is above the blue line, and then the super trend indicator gives a buy signal, in that order. you would miss out on a lot of opportunities like this one. Another tip for using this strategy is maybe implementing another indicator called the Fibonacci Bollinger Bands. I didn t end up backtesting the strategy with this indicator, but I did look at a couple examples and saw you would get potentially more profit if using this indicator with the strategy. If one you wants to backtest this strategy with the Fibonnaci bolling bands added, leave in the comments what the results were, if the strategy was better with, or without them. Because again, I want to make this channel a community where we all help each other out. But lets get on to how to use the fibonnaci Bollinger bands with this strategy. So all you have to do is go to the indicators tab, and type in fbb for fibonnaci bolliner bands. Then go to the settings of the indicator, and uncheck all the boxes besides the boxes with the 1 s. Then change the colors to red just so you can see the lines better. These lines are basically going to be acting as the absolute highs and lows for the price. So if the price ever touches the red line, we are going to sell immediately, even if the super trend indicator still has a buy signal. If the price does ever hit the fibonnaci Bollinger band, it usually reflects off it and goes the opposite direction. So as you can see in this example. The price hit our Bollinger band, so we sold here, even though the super trend indicator was still green. And if we fast forward, we made more money selling here, then if sold when the super trend indicator told us. The price will rarely high these fibonnaci Bollinger bands, but if it does. Sell. Like Is said, I didn t backtest this strategy with the Bollinger bands, but I did check a couple example with it, and it was more profitable a majority of the time. Next, let s take a look at the back test results for the original strategy. For this backtest, I traded both doge/usd and LTC/usd. I did 100 trades. Which took a round 2.5 months. The most wins in a row I had with this strategy was 8, and the most losses in a row was 3. This stat by itself, is insanely good for a trading strategy. The total amount of gains from the 100 trades was 130.14% and the trading strategy had a success rate of 60% with 60 winning trades, and 40 loosing trades. If you want to learn how to backtest trades like this and test your own personal strategies, watch this video where I go over how to do so and backtest your strategies with years of data on tradingview, so you can see just how profitable your strategies actually are. Thanks for watching and ill see you guys, next time.","id":"g-PLctW8aU0","microformat":{"playerMicroformatRenderer":{"category":"Education","description":{"simpleText":"I found a strategy that profited 130.14% in just 2 and half months of trading.

Seen in many forms of nature all around the world. Flower petals, shells, galaxies, hurricanes, and even faces? So it s seen all around in nature, but can we use it in trading to help predict markets? The Fibonacci sequence starts like this. Each number is the sum of the two numbers before that. It s a simple pattern, but it appears to be a kind of built in numbering system in nature. And it s one of the reasons why charts, look like this, creating higher highs and higher lows. So can we use this tool to help find a specific spot where a pullback has a high chance of bouncing off and creating a new higher high? Yes. And I m going to tell you exactly how to use the fibonnaci retracement tool the right way, what a common mistake people make while using it, and show you how to exit your trades correctly so you get the most profit as possible. Let s get straight to it. So what are fibonnaci retracements? They are key levels from the fibonnaci retracement tool, that can help you find the reversal of a pullback. Let me show you a great example of when to use these levels. A lot of traders like to wait and trade off a pullback. Considering 1. it s usually at a cheap and great price and 2. It s usually a place where a change in price will happen. This is usually how a normal trade would go. You see an uptrend. You also notice there is a key level acting as both a support and resistance. So you now know, if the price does end up making a pullback at that level, there s a great chance of it bouncing off and creating new higher high. Making it a great level to buy if It shows confirmation. But what if you were in a position like this? Where the price went up and made a pullback, but there weren t any previous key levels of support or resistance. How do you know where the key levels are for a reversal to happen? The answer? The fibonnaci retracement tool. If we plot these levels, you can see the price respected them, and actually used these levels as a key support. Another great example of the finbonnci s magic is the Snp 500. If we go back to when Corona hit, you can see this Fibonacci tool predicted the exact bottom for the crash. Let s go over the best settings for this tool. To do that, get on Tradingview. If you don t have it, ill leave a link in the description. Next, click this icon right here, and make sure it s on fibonnaci retracement. Just place it anywhere on the chart, and click the setting icon. What we want to do, is uncheck 0.382 and the uncheck all the other boxes after 1. Next, uncheck the background. I know the colors are fancy, but this mostly just makes your chart messy. Then uncheck prices, and change the levels from values, to precents. These are the settings that I have found work the best for me, and it make s it look really clean on the chart. So now that we have the correct settings, let move on to how to use tool correctly. First things first, we need to find a clear trend. In this example, you can see a clear trend. With an swing high, and an swing low. The next step is to drag your fibonnaci retracement tool from the swing low, to the swing high. One common mistake that I see a lot of traders making is that drag from the candles body, rather than the candles wick. The price didn t stop here. Sure it might of ended up here, but this was not the lowest it went. So when making your fibonnaci levels, make sure you are going all the way down to the wick. So once you have dragged your fibonnaci retracement tool from the swing low, to the swing high. It s time to understand how to read these levels. So with my specific settings you are going to have 6 levels. The 0% level is basically you starting point. The other 5 levels are your pullback levels. Meaning that if price hits one of these levels and respects it, and starts reversing. It s very likely that it will go up to the next highest level or even higher. The most common levels you will see this happen with, are these three levels. 23.60, 50, and 61.80. A lot of traders will call this area the golden zone . This tool will also tell us what is considered a pullback. If the price bounces off any of these lines, its considered a pullback. Meaning there s a chance for it to bounce off and go to the next level. If the price beaks below the 100 line, it will likely try to come back, and fall. Starting a downtrend. So it s important to note. If the price ever goes below your 100 line, it s pretty likely it will fall a lot more after that. You should also understand that you need to treat these levels just as you would for support and resistances. They are not solid line, they are areas. Meaning, the price is not always going to respect the exact level where the line is. Just because the price falls below a line, doesn t necessarily mean it has broken that area. It could still reverse from this point. So I guess what I m trying to say, is don t treat these levels as an exact measurement. You just should be treating them as a guide. How do you know which level the price will reverse at? Well how about I show you an example. So, here we found a clear trend upwards. We identified the swing low of the trend, and the swing high. Next, we select our fibonnaci retracement tool, and dragged from the swing lows wick, to the swing high s wick. Next, we see what price does. We see the price retested this 0% level, but just as I said before, just because price breaks through a level, doesn t necessarily mean its certain. So as you can see it test the level and got rejected. It end up doing that two more times, telling us that it really want to go above this level. Next we see come down to the 23.60% level. And look how much it Is respecting this line. Once I see this candle right here, I m probably entering the trade, because I can be pretty certain the price will go up from here as a pullback, or at lease go to the 0% level. So I set my stop loss right below the 23.60% line and then I m going to sell half my shares at the 0% line. Let s see what the price does. It turns out we were right, and the price went up the 0% line, give us a nice little profit. So, we sell half our shares so guarantee that profit. But we are not done. As I said before. Price has tried breaking through this line multiple times, telling us it really wants to go up from here. So that s why we are keeping half our shares in the game. We see that price breaks through the level, and comes back down and respects it. This right here, is like seeing gold on your screen. The price broke through, made a slight pull back and respected the highest level. Meaning, it s about to make a big move upward. After I see a bit of confirmation. I raise my stop loss below the 0% level. Then look what happens. The price sky rockets. So as a quick overview. Let s go over some key moments of this trade. There were multiple times price tried breaking through the 0 line, but we never entered at these points, because there was never any confirmation it was going up. Another key point is when the price went down to the 23.60% level, we only entered after seeing the price respected this line, and gave us confirmation it was going up. Just because the price hits a line, doesn t mean it will respect it. You should always be looking for confirmation. It is a very important concept to understand when using the fibonnaci retracement tool. Example is ltcusd Nov 9 Here Is another great example. We found a clear trend upwards. We identified the swing low and the swing high. We made sure to put our levels all the way to the wicks. Then we wait and see what price does. We see that price slightly respects this level by 1 candle resisting it, but probably not enough information to enter the trade yet. Then price tries to break the 0 line and then come and reverses back to the 23.60 line. We then see a candle appear, not even thinking about respecting this line at all, breaking right through it. This might be a good spot to enter a short, but you probably need a bit more confirmation. So, we wait. We see it kind of bounce off the 50% line, then hits it again, going through it. Then the price consolidates in this area, not know what it wants to do. Whenever price consolidates like this. Price can go in either direction. So it s usually not a good time to enter. It ends up breaking up wards, going all the way to the 23.60 line again, but then gets rejected. After seeing this confirmation candle, this would be a pretty nice place to enter a short trade. Considering the price is respecting this resistance, and last time this happened it went down to the 61.80 line. We see price goes back down to where it did before, and does another one of those reversals going back to the 23.60 line and respecting it another time. So if you missed going in the time before this, the is an absolute great time to enter a short trade. So now that we are for sure in the trade now. I should also mention. That you should be selling a percentage of your trade for each level that gets hit. Get the profit confirmation. Its very important rule, and is critical to become a profitable trader. So what does price do? It drops back down to the 50% line. It sort of respects, but is still kind of unsure. We still sell around 25% of our shares at this level, for guaranteed profit. Next we see a monster of a candle break through the 61.80 line. The next couple candles start respecting this line. We sell another 25% of our original entry and see what price does. It goes up breaking through the 61.80 line and doesn t quite make it to the 50 line, after losing momentum, it drops back down to the 78.60 line. So we now know, this 78.60 line is a pretty strong support, considering the price keeps stoping right around here. So we know, if price ever breaks through this point, It s going to drop hard. And look what happens, price breaks through it. Making it go all the way down below the 100 level. We sell another 25% of our original entry and keep the last of the money in the trade for high return gains. We ve now made a really good profit, and we are even still in the trade. And look what happens the price price comes back up the to the 100 level, starts resisting. This right here, is that gold moment I was talking about before. After seeing this, we have a pretty good idea the price will drop. A lot. And look what happens. Price drops. Another key tip will help you guys out a lot, is if you ever find a fibonnaci level where it matches up with a key level of support, like this example. The white line was placed here, because it way key support level on the daily time frame. Then we have the red 23.60% line from the fibonnaci right by it. This means, that this level right here, is very likely to be a strong support or resistance. And as you can see. The price did exactly that and treated this area as a strong resistance. So some key takeaways. You should be treating your fibonnaci levels as areas not solid lines. Always wait for confirmation before entering a trade. Sell percentage of position for every level that is hit. If you find an area with a strong daily support and a fibonnaci level, there is greater chance price will respect that level.

Your trading strategy gives you all the signals to enter a trade, so you enter. The chart is looking extremely nice, and you re confident the price is about to go up. You set your stop loss, set your take profit, and then have you eyes glued to the monitor. It turns out you were right about the chart going up, but unfortunately, the price barely hit your stop loss before doing so. Resulting this as a losing trade, and most importantly, missing out on all this potential profit. What if there was a way to know exactly where to set you stop loss? To have an indicator tell you the exact position where to set it, so it lowers the chance immensely of it ever getting hit. Well lucky for you, there is a way. And I m going to tell you exactly how to execute it on all your trading strategies. Let s get straight to it. So here we have our rookie trader. They saw their indicators line up, so they entered a trade. They set their stop loss at the recent swing low. Thinking it was a good idea, because if the price does go below the swing low, they want to be out of the trade anyway. Then we have our professional trader. Who entered the trade the same price, but used the special strategy I m about to share with you to set their stop loss. Look what happened. The rookie trader ended up losing this trade, and the professional came out with a huge profit. Even though they entered at the exact same price. The only difference, is the position of their stop loss. So what is this mysterious indicator that will help you place your stop loss and lowering the chance of it getting stopped out? It is the ATR, or the average true range. I use this indicator in basically all of my trading strategies to help decide where to place my stop losses. We are going to talk about what the ATR is, why you should be using it, and how to implement it in your strategies so you set your stop losses at the correct position every time. So what is the ATR? The ATR is the average true range. What this indicator is doing, is taking the past 14 candles, and is telling us what the average size of those 14 candles is. Now whenever you add this indicator to your chart, you can change the settings of it to whatever you want. So you can make it look at the past 50 candles, or 5 candles, whatever number you wanted. Me personally, I like keeping it at the default of 14. So this indicator on the bottom is the ATR indicator. It s just a simple line chart, that has a changing value in the top left. This number is presenting the average size of the past 14 candles of this specific security, which is Etherium. So it s saying, the average candle size of the past 14 candles for Ethereum is $17.32 Now, why is it important to know the average candle size of the past 14 candles? The simple answer is knowing the recent volatility of the market. Let me show you an example. So say just for simplicity sake, you wanted to enter right here. You want to set your stop loss right below this recent swing low, which is actually what a lot of other traders are doing. And lets say, you think, to prevent the price from hitting your stop loss, you are going to move your stop loss down $10 from the original, so if the price does go down to the recent swing low. It still has a chance to bounce off, and go back up. While you re strategy is some what in the right direction. Let me tell you why this will not work. Every crypto, every stock, every currency, is going to have different amounts of volatility. So bitcoin is going to move up and down a lot more than a blue chip stock, like apple. You don t want to be moving your stop loss down the same amount for crypto as you would a blue chip stock. Considering they are two completely different markets, and have way different price movements. Depending on what your trading. Your stop loss might have to be larger or smaller. Same goes with different time frames. Here you can see the average candle size of the past 14 candles for bitcoin on the 15 minute time frame is $200, but if we move to the daily time frame. The average candle size is $3000. So this is a perfect example of why you need larger stop losses on higher time frames compared to smaller time frames. You also want your stop losses to be as effective as possible. Like this. So lets say, we know there is a great probability that the price will fall a lot if it goes below this line. But, we also know that we have to take volatility into consideration. But we will say the price can go below this line the amount of an average candle from the past 14 candles. But we don t want to just guess the average size, because if we do any more than what the actual size is, that s just wasting extra money. We want our stop loss to be as precise as possible. This is where, ATR comes into play. First things first, get on your chart platform, I use tradingview, I ll leave a link in the description. Go to the indicators tab, and type in ATR, for average true range. This will put the atr on the bottom of your screen. Now it s also important to note, this value in the top left will change based on where your cursor is. So if you have your cursor in the middle of the chart, it s taking the past 14 candles to the left of that line. So when reading the ATR, make sure your cursor is all the way to the right of price, or off the chart completely So in this example, this number, is the average candle size from the last 14 candles for etherium. So once you find where you want to place your stop place, say this recent swing low for example. Instead of dropping your stop loss a random amount below that level, you should be taking volatility into consideration. So what you do, is take the price of the stock, crypto, or whatever your trading. And subtract it with the ATR value. So in this example our stop loss level is at 4339 and our atr value is 16.02. So what you do is take 4339 and subtract 16.02 from it. Giving us 4,322.98. This is the new level of where we are going to be setting our stop loss So in this example . So yes, we do have a larger stop loss, but that s the whole point. We don t want to get stopped out because the market is more volatile than we thought. Let s do one more example. So here we set our stop loss at the most recent swing low, which is at 310 . We then see what the ATR value is, which is 2.58. We then do 310.75 2.58 which equals 308.17. 308.17 is where we move our top loss too. If you use this strategy for placing your stop losses. It s pretty safe to say your stop losses wont be hit as often. So for all my strategies, where I say to set your stop loss at a certain point. You should be adding the ATR to it, to give it that extra amount of room for volatility. It will help the strategy perform so much better. Try it with this strategy. Where I made a 130% return in just 2 months of trading. It s a crazy strategy and is insanely powerful. Thanks for watching, and ill see you guys next time.","id":"txXUUeMDos8","microformat":{"playerMicroformatRenderer":{"category":"Education","description":{"simpleText":"Want to know how and where to set your stop loss?

huge 10 gain and massive profit helping out my portfolio so much how did i know this chart was about to go up because of this candlestick pattern right here and in this video i'm gonna share my favorite candlestick patterns just like this one that i use on a daily basis that way you can read and understand chart patterns predict chart direction become a more successful trader and make plays just like this one let's get straight to it shall we one of my favorite and most used candlestick patterns i like to trade with is the engulfing candle i've used it in many of my previous videos it's such a strong candlestick because it can give you the exact point of when a reversal is about to happen what is an engulfing candlestick well it basically explains itself in the name it's a candlestick in the opposite color of the previous candle and it simply engulfs it a bullish engulfing candle opens at or is lower than the previous candles close and closes above the previous candles open so basically being bigger than the previous candle on both sides making it look as if it's engulfing it let me show you an example so here we found a pretty strong support where price bounced off it multiple times telling us it really respects it we see the price comes back down to the support we can expect it to bounce back up but before entering we need a little more confirmation rather than just assuming the support will hold that's when we see a bullish engulfing candle it completely engulfs the previous red candle and is exactly at the support this is an extremely bullish sign and we can be pretty confident the price will go up from here so we enter the trade and look what happens now it's also important to note that just because there is a bullish or bearish engulfing candle doesn't mean the price is going to reverse in that direction every time you shouldn't be just trading purely off candlestick patterns you should be using them as almost if they were hints on which way the market is about to go not pure decision makers you should be using other tools with candlestick patterns like support and resistances indicators different strategies etc so just to be clear just because you see a bullish engulfing candle doesn't mean the price will go up from there but it can be a good indicator that the price will head in that direction let me show you a bearish example so here we have the same type of setup a strong resistance where the price respected it multiple times before and we see the price comes back up and starts to slow down giving us a bearish engulfing candle completely engulfing the previous green candle we see that it got rejected at the resistance and there was a bearish engulfing candle indicating this is a good sign to go short and look what happens price goes down next we have the momentum candle the momentum candle is a lot easier to spot than the engulfing candle purely because of its size a momentum candle is simply a candle that is two to three times bigger than the previous candles before it this candle can be insanely powerful because most of the time after it happens the price will continue to go in that direction making this point a great time to enter the most efficient and effective way to use this candlestick pattern is in choppy markets where the price is moving sideways if you ever see a sideways market then a huge momentum candlestick appears being two to three times bigger than the previous candles you can be pretty certain that the price will continue in that direction why is that well think of it like this whenever there is a sideways market like this there are a lot of shorters stuck in their trades they don't want to exit their trade yet because the price is moving sideways and it can honestly still move in either direction they draw their support and resistance and set their stop losses right above the support so that means they're going to be tons of traders setting stop losses all over this area meaning if there's a sudden price movement and price hits this liquidation zone all these stop losses will be hit just adding fuel to the fire for this price to keep moving up also when price breaks a choppy market like this it'll usually start a trend in that direction it's the same type of strategy with shorts if there's a choppy sideways market and you see a huge red candle two to three times bigger than the candles before it this is a great indicator to enter a short position because it's likely the price will continue to move downwards next we have the multiple candlestick pattern this is one of my favorites as it usually holds pretty true on charts and it's also pretty simple all it is is when you have three or more candles that have wicks going one direction the more candles the better i like to pair this candlestick pattern with support and resistances so look at this chart what do you see happening well for one we have a key support where price bounces off multiple times then we have multiple candles with wicks going downwards exactly at the support as you can see all these candles have downward wicks telling us that sellers are trying to break the support but buyers keep fighting them off and are winning multiple times confirming that this is a key support and price has a good chance of bouncing upwards as said before the more candles the better the probability the price will respect that pattern let's go over a short example price moved to the resistance there are multiple candles with wicks heading upwards telling us that price really doesn't want to move up from here giving us a good short entry so we enter here expecting price to reverse from this point and look what happens it does next we have the doji candle the doji candle is a candlestick with a very thin body and it has wicks on each side why this one is so important to understand is because it can be a great indicator on when the price is about to reverse in a direction what this candle basically represents is the market is uncertain on which way it wants to go and is having resistance whenever there is uncertainty or resistance the price will more often than not head in the opposite direction let's see an example so here we have price moving down pretty hard then a green candle appears and it just so happens to be a doji candle this is telling us that sellers are starting to be less confident and buyers are starting to enter making this point a great potential place to enter what i normally like to do with doji candles is after i see one i'll wait for two or more candles the same color to confirm that the price will reverse so in this example i see a green doji candle i wait see two more green candles heading upwards telling me i can be confident that the price will continue in that direction so this is the point where i enter the trade and boom the price goes up from here there are multiple different variations of the doji candle that you might see there is the regular one which is the one that we just talked about in the last example the long-legged doji candle which is basically the same candle but just has larger wicks the dragonfly which has a small body and a big bottom wick then the gravestone which has a small body and has a big upper wick all of these tell the same exact story a reversal in price the next candlestick we'll be looking at is the hammer the hammer is usually a candle that looks like this a decent sized body and a long wick what this candle is telling us is that sellers got the price all the way down to here but the buyers absorbed all that selling pressure and raised the price all the way back up this is usually an extremely bullish sign and can tell us that the market will continue to go in that direction a candlestick that is very similar to the hammer is the shooting star the shooting star is just like the hammer but it has a small wake on the opposite side you should be playing this just like the hammer where if you see a shooting star candle like this you can have a good suspicion that the price will start reversing this next candlestick pattern is called the tweezer this pattern is a red candlestick followed by a green candlestick both having similar wicks on the bottom if you see this pair you can have a pretty good idea this chart is about to move upwards let's see an example so here we can see price is about to hit this support we see a red candle with a wick on the bottom right at the support then we see a green candle that also has a wick heading downwards this is telling us that the price is respecting this support and is now getting some momentum upwards this would be a great time to buy and look what happens price raises it's the exact opposite for a bearish signal so you want to see a green candlestick then a red both having wicks at the top we see that exact pattern here and boom price falls the last and final candlestick pattern i want to talk about is the marabozu the bullish maribozu is going to be a big green candle without any wicks so basically just a big green rectangle the cool thing about this pattern is that it's a good indicator that price will keep heading in the same direction it's going you will usually see this candle in the middle of a trend confirming that the trend will keep moving upwards let's see an example so here we saw a price reversal price is starting to head upwards then we see a bullish maribozu candle notice how the candle has no upper or lower wicks this means that the lowest price of this candle was the exact same as its opening price and the highest point of this candle is the exact same as its closing price this is telling us that buyers have complete control and we can almost certainly predict that price will continue to go upwards and look what happens it does the bearish maribozu is the same idea a red candle with no winks here we see the price had a reversal we see a bearish maribozu candle telling us sellers have control and the price will probably keep moving downwards we enter making this a winning trade now it's time to give you a bonus tip for all those who made it to the end of the video this is a way of me saying thanks for watching all the way to the end even though you should probably try to memorize these patterns so when you see them you can have an idea of what the market is going to do in the back of your head i completely understand that it's hard sometimes to look for them or even remember what they look like well lucky for you there is a way to make it so you can have your chart tell you exactly where a certain type of candlestick pattern occurs which makes it really easy for you to spot them and you don't even necessarily have to memorize them to do this just go to trading view click the indicators tab type in whatever candlestick pattern you want so for this example we'll do a bullish engulfing simply click it and training view will notify you on the chart when the bullish engulfing candle appears making it extremely easy to spot when it happens and you don't even have to look that hard you can also add multiple candlestick patterns to your chart so you can identify when any of them occur i hope you guys got some value out of this and you learned something new if you did i would really appreciate it if you took five seconds out of your day and like this video the one and only problem trading with candlestick patterns is false breakouts where a certain candlestick pattern occurs but the price actually does the exact opposite of what the pattern predicts if you want to learn how to avoid situations like this watch this video where i go over my secret strategy to avoid false breakouts thanks for watching and i'll see you guys next time

A doji candle is a candlestick that has a very thin body and long wick on each side. What a lot of traders will do, is once then see a downtrend, then a green doji candle appears, they think that means an instant reversal will happen. So they enter here. The problem is, doji candles don t automatically mean that there s going to be a reversal. It s just a simple way of the market telling us its uncertain of what it want s to do next. So a lot of the time, there will be a big move after a doji, but it s not always upwards. Don t just jump in a trade because you see a green doji candle. If you want to use a doji for an entry. Simply just wait to see if the next candle will break the high of the doji for confirmation. Once it does, then enter the trade. here's a mistake i see traders make all the time when using doji candles a doji candle is a candlestick that has a very thin body and long wicks on each side what a lot of traders will do is once they see a downtrend then a green doji candle appears they think that means an instant reversal will happen so they enter here the problem is doji candles don't automatically mean that there's gonna be a reversal it's just a simple way of the market telling us it's uncertain of what it wants to do next so a lot of the time there will be a big move after a doji but it's not always upwards don't just jump in a trade because you see a green doji candle if you want to use a doji for an entry simply just wait to see if the next candle will break the high of the doji for confirmation once it does then enter the trade","id":"4xIBNEPTEp0","title":"The Common MISTAKE Traders Make With Doji Candles #Shorts","microformat":{"playerMicroformatRenderer":{"thumbnail":{"thumbnails":[{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4xIBNEPTEp0/maxres2.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEoCIAKENAF8quKqQMcGADwAQH4AbYIgAKAD4oCDAgAEAEYfyAiKDUwDw==&rs=AOn4CLB5KRK9IUzwbhL_cWKWfsMvGGxdXw","width":1280,"height":720}]},"embed":{"iframeUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xIBNEPTEp0","width":1280,"height":720},"title":{"simpleText":"The Common MISTAKE Traders Make With Doji Candles #Shorts"},"description":{"simpleText":"In this video, I give a quick example of a common mistake traders make with Doji candles and how you can use them correctly. \n\nIf you learned something new, leave a like.\n\nTrading Discord: https://discord.gg/5MGeeCWa\n\n► Scanz (News Screener I Use): http://www.scanz.com?fpr=tradinglab\n\n► TradingView (Chart Software I Use): https://www.tradingview.com/?offer_id=10&aff_id=28566\n\n► Get 2 FREE stocks valued up to $1850 (when you deposit $100): https://act.webull.com/on/A6BoDyk5xy2A/zbk/inviteUs/main\n\n► Get up to $250 in Crypto Currency: https://blockfi.com/?ref=ca9f3260\n\n🔴 Subscribe for more videos just like this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCbv0qixG-cyokxEY3kELtg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow TradingLab: \n===============================\n📸 - IG: https://www.instagram.com/tradinglabofficial/\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.
